An Employment Application Review System API

EARS is a Web-Based Employment Application Review System for the school of
Computer Science and Technology in Algoma University. The system is designed so that
the chairperson of the school can assign faculty members to the evaluation committee to
review applicants and collaborate asynchronously in order to find the best applicant for a
given job opening. This system reduces the overhead of the process and lightens the
workload for the chairperson.
